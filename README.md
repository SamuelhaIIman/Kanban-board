# Kanban Board
This project doesn't work anymore.

The objective was to create a Kanban board using a three-tier architecture. The board was implemented through a Windows Forms application, requiring a database for the program to persist data. We initially employed an ER model, UML class model, and wireframe model. Additional functionalities for the program were defined in the project plan. Throughout the course, we utilized the KanbanFlow application to track completed and pending tasks. We used the Microsoft Access Database to save our Kanban board information.

We had five people working on this project. And we had six iterations that were one and a half weeks long. We used purely C# Windows forms to create our project.
